# üíä Django Medication Tracker

Medication Tracker is a full-stack web application designed to help users efficiently manage and monitor their personal medication schedules with ease, reliability, and privacy. The application provides a secure and user-friendly platform for individuals seeking to stay on top of their medication routines and health management.

Visitors to the site can explore the homepage to learn about the purpose of the app and its core features. To begin tracking their medications, users are required to register for an account through a secure sign-up process. Once registered, users can log in to access the full functionality of the app.

Logged-in users are able to create new medication records, each containing key details such as name, dosage, and frequency. Users can also edit or delete existing entries, ensuring their medication list remains up to date. The platform includes the option to report side effects per medication and categorize both medications and side effects using dropdown fields for clarity and consistency. A responsive, paginated table allows users to easily browse and sort through their current medications.

Admin users benefit from access to a dedicated dashboard that provides an overview of all submitted medications and side effects. The dashboard includes visual summaries of top categories, gender-based breakdowns, and total counts, and enables admins to manage user-generated data effectively. The admin panel, powered by Django, ensures secure and centralized data oversight.

The site‚Äôs front end is built with Bootstrap 5, offering a clean and responsive design that performs well across devices. All application data is stored and managed using Django‚Äôs robust backend architecture, with role-based authentication and permissions to ensure users can only access and manage their own data.

Overall, Medication Tracker serves as a streamlined and personalized tool for users aiming to support their health routines and improve medication adherence in a secure digital environment.

## üíä Create, update and delete medications

- **Add Medication!** Users manage their medications through a user-friendly interface. Users add medications by filling a form with fields for medication name, dosage (e.g., ‚Äú500mg‚Äù), frequency (times per day), start and end dates, and selecting a health category from a dropdown list. Categories include Joints and Muscles, Gut Health, Skin, Eyes-Ears-Nose-Throat, Headaches and Dizziness, and Heart Health, ensuring consistent classification of medication purposes. They are able to record, edit, or remove medications they are taking to keep track of treatment accurately.

<details>

![Index results](readme-docs/add_medication.png)

  </details>

- **Edit & Delete:** Users can update or remove medications they previously added. Forms are pre-populated with current data for ease of editing. Deletions prompt confirmation to prevent accidental loss.

#### Features

- CreateView (MedicationCreate) allows logged-in users to add new medications.

- Medication data includes:

  - Name, Dosage, Frequency, Start/End Date, Category (dropdown), and optional Notes.

- Uses custom-styled form widgets (Bootstrap) for a clean UI.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Reporting of side effects per medication

As seen in the previous screenshots users are able to log any side effects they experience for specific medication so that they can track how treatments affect them. Users are able categorize side effects from a predefined list to ensure consistency and ensure that reporting is made easier.

<details>
  <summary>Report side effect</summary>

![Index results](readme-docs/side_effects_page.png)

  </details>

<details>
  <summary>Visual of reported side effect</summary>

![Index results](readme-docs/reported_side_effects.png)

  </details>


#### Features

- From the medication list page, users can report side effects using the SideEffectForm.

- Each side effect is:

  - Linked to a specific medication.

  - Categorized via dropdown (SIDE_EFFECT_CATEGORIES): Nausea or Vomiting, Fatigue or Weakness, Rashes or Skin Issues, Mood Changes, Muscle or Joint Pain, Heart Palpitations or Chest Pain.

  - Users provide detailed textual descriptions explaining their symptoms or experiences.

- Reported side effects are stored with timestamps (reported_on) and associated with the reporting user.

### View medication and side effect lists

- The app displays medications in a paginated list, showing all relevant details. Each medication is tied to the logged-in user, enforcing privacy, while also allowing quick access and monitoring.

#### Features

- MedicationList displays:

  - User‚Äôs medications (or all for superusers).

  - Paginated with 6 items per page.

  - Includes sorting by name, user (admin only), and date created.

- Side effects are grouped and displayed under each medication using a dictionary (side_effects_by_med).

### Delete side effect lists

- Users are able to remove a previously reported side effect if it was added in error.

#### Features

- SideEffectDelete view provides deletion with access restricted to the original reporter.

- Confirmation template ensures no accidental deletions.

---

### Admin dashboard overview

- Admin users have access to a dashboard that gives me insight into medication and side effect usage patterns across all users.

#### Features

- Access restricted via @staff_member_required.

- Dashboard displays:

  - Total number of medications and side effects. The dashboard displays overall counts of medications and side effects recorded.

  - Top medication and side effects categories (global and by gender). Data is grouped by health categories for medications and side effect categories, showing the most common entries.

<details>
  <summary>Admin Dashboard Medications</summary>

![Index results](readme-docs/medication_pie_chart.png)

  </details>

<details>
  <summary>Admin Dashboard Sideffect</summary>

![Index results](readme-docs/sideeffect_pie_chart.png)

  </details>

- Admins are capable to analyze medication and side effect trends based on users' genders to understand how experiences vary. Data is grouped by Male, Female or Other. The visual grouping structure is prepared (gender_medication_data, gender_side_effect_data) and includes an ‚ÄúAll‚Äù group for comparison across entire dataset.

- The graphs uses raw SQL queries for performance and flexibility. While I understand Django‚Äôs ORM is powerful and simplifies most database interactions, I chose to use raw SQL in parts of this project particularly in the admin dashboard. This wasn‚Äôt just for performance and flexibility, but because in this project I wanted to highlight my ability to write and work with SQL directly.

While I understand that it would‚Äôve been easier to do everything using the ORM, I think including raw SQL allowed me to handle more complex queries and aggregations efficiently, like joining user profiles with medications and side effects based on gender. This was a great opportunity to demonstrate that I‚Äôm comfortable stepping outside the ORM when needed and understand what‚Äôs going on.

## [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

The overall look and feel of the site is driven primarily by Bootstrap‚Äôs responsive utility classes and Django‚Äôs built-in features. Leveraging Bootstrap allowed for a modern, streamlined layout that minimized the need for redundant styling while still delivering a clean, polished, personal and user-friendly interface, something I really enjoyed working on.

In contrast, the forms.html template includes custom CSS styling via a separate stylesheet, which was validated with zero errors. This allowed for more precise control over specific layout and design elements where needed.

## Automated Testing

This project includes automated tests for the medications app, ensuring key components function correctly and reliably. The tests are written using Django‚Äôs testing framework and cover the following areas:

- Form Validation Tests
    - MedicationForm:

        - Validates that the form accepts correct and complete data.

        - Ensures the form rejects submissions with missing or invalid fields.

    - SideEffectForm:

        - Validates correct data inputs.

        - Checks that forms with empty or invalid data are rejected.

- View Tests
    - Medication List View:

        - Confirms the view loads successfully for authenticated users.

        - Checks the correct template is used to render the medication list page.

        - Verifies user login is required (via test setup with logged-in user).

If I had more time, I would have extended automated testing to cover the remaining Python files and views across the project. Expanding test coverage was planned to further ensure robustness and maintainability.
