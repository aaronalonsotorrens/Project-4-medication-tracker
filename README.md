# üíä Django Medication Tracker

Medication Tracker is a web app designed to help users manage and track their personal medication schedules with ease and reliability.

Unregistered users can access the homepage to learn more about the purpose of the app and its features. To begin using the app, users must register an account via the sign-up form. Once registered, users can securely log in to access the full functionality of the tracker.

Logged-in users can create new medication entries, browse a list of all their current medications, and update or delete existing entries as needed. Each medication record includes details such as name, dosage, frequency and the option to report side effects.

From their personalized dashboard, users have a clear view of all active medications and their status. The clean, responsive design ensures a smooth experience across devices, whether managing prescriptions at home or on the go.

Medication data is securely stored and managed through the backend, built with Django. The admin panel allows site administrators to oversee all user activity, manage medications, and perform data maintenance tasks as needed.

This project is ideal for individuals seeking a straightforward, user-friendly tool to support their health routine and medication adherence.

This rich, dynamic dashboard supports better monitoring and informed decision-making to improve user health management.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

- **Models:** The `Medication` model stores medication details, user linkage, and category selections. The `SideEffect` model links side effects to medications and users, with categorized types and descriptions. User demographic data is stored separately in a `UserProfile` model extending Django‚Äôs default User.

- **Forms:** Custom forms leverage Django‚Äôs forms framework with styled widgets for consistent UI:
  - `CustomSignupForm` extends Django Allauth signup, adding fields for first name, last name, gender (dropdown), age, and country (using django-countries).
  - `MedicationForm` handles medication data entry with input validation and dropdowns for categories.
  - `SideEffectForm` manages side effect reporting, with dropdown selection and a textarea for detailed descriptions.

- **Views:** Class-based views handle listing, creating, updating, and deleting medications with user access control. Side effect reporting and deletion include POST handling with messages for success/failure feedback. The admin dashboard view uses raw SQL and staff-only access restrictions.

- **User Experience:** Pagination, dropdown menus, and confirmation prompts ensure ease of use and prevent accidental data loss. Side effects are displayed grouped by medication for context.
